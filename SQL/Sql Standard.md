It is a standardised programming language by ACSI and ISO. They both have their own version of SQL, and which are almost the same. 

Words which are part of SQL syntax are keyword.
Keywords like `select` cannot be used as identifiers so these are not reserved words.
All reserved words are keywords.

Reserved are words are the words which can be used as identifiers (Identifier example: column name) with quotes. 
Reserved word example: user
```sql
create table test_table
id int,
'user' varchar(100)
```

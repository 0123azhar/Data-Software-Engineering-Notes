# Concurrency

**Concurrency:** 
the ability of a system to allow multiple tasks to start, run, and complete in overlapping time periods, but not necessarily simultaneously.
**Parallelism:**
tasks are divided into smaller sub-tasks that can be processed at the same time across multiple CPU cores

Below modules are used for Concurrency and Parallelism in python
1. [[multiprocessing]]
3. [[threading]]
4. [[asyncio]]
the first two modules are used to code synchronous programs like any other module
asyncio is used to implement asynchronous programing in your code.

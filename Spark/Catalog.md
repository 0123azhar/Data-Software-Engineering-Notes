The Spark SQL Catalog is a crucial component of Apache Spark that acts as a central repository for managing metadata about various data resources like databases, tables, functions, and views within Spark. When Spark is configured to use Hive, it automatically uses the Hive Metastore as its catalog storage. This allows Spark to access and manipulate tables created in Hive and vice versa, facilitating interoperability between Spark and Hive in a shared ecosystem.

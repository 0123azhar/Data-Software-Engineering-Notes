- **Memory Pools**: Python maintains pools of memory for small objects (less than 256 bytes), especially for frequently created and destroyed objects. These pools helps to reduce fragmentation and improve allocation efficiency.
- **PyMalloc**: Pythonâ€™s specialized memory allocator, `PyMalloc`, is optimized for managing small objects.

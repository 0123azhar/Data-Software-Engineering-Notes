# Coalesce Repartision

In Apache Spark, `coalesce` and `repartition` are used to control the number of partitions of a DataFrame or RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset), but they have different purposes and behaviors.

### 1. **Coalesce:**

- **Purpose:** `coalesce` is used to reduce the number of partitions in a DataFrame or RDD. It is commonly used when you want to decrease the number of partitions ==after a wide transformation==, such as `groupBy` or `join`, which can significantly increase the number of partitions.

- **Behavior:** When you use `coalesce`, Spark tries to reduce the number of partitions without performing a full shuffle across the network. Instead, it combines the data into fewer partitions by ==merging adjacent partitions== together, which is more efficient but might result in ==uneven partition sizes==.

- **Use Case:** It's generally used when you need to decrease the number of partitions, especially when the new number of partitions is significantly less than the current number. For instance, after a `groupBy` operation, you might want to reduce the partitions from 100 to 10.

```python
df = df.coalesce(10)
```

- **Performance:** Since it avoids a full shuffle, it is more efficient for reducing partitions compared to `repartition`.

### 2. **Repartition:**

- **Purpose:** `repartition` is used to either increase or decrease the number of partitions in a DataFrame or RDD.

- **Behavior:** Unlike `coalesce`, `repartition` performs a full shuffle of the data across the cluster, which ensures that the data is ==evenly distributed== across all partitions. This is especially useful when you want to increase the number of partitions or need a uniform distribution of data across partitions.

- **Use Case:** It's generally used when you want to increase the number of partitions or if you need to redistribute data evenly, for instance, to improve parallelism ==before a large computation or write== operation.

```python
df = df.repartition(20)
```

- **Performance:** `repartition` is more expensive than `coalesce` because it involves a full shuffle, but it guarantees even distribution of data.

### **Key Differences:**

1. **Shuffling:**
   - `coalesce` avoids a full shuffle, making it more efficient for reducing partitions.
   - `repartition` always performs a full shuffle, making it suitable for both increasing and decreasing partitions while ensuring even distribution.

2. **Use Case:**
   - Use `coalesce` when you only want to reduce the number of partitions and can tolerate uneven distribution.
   - Use `repartition` when you need to increase partitions or require an even distribution of data.

3. **Performance:**
   - `coalesce` is more efficient for reducing partitions because it minimizes data movement.
   - `repartition` is more flexible but more expensive in terms of computational cost due to the shuffle.
